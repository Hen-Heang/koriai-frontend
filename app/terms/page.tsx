        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">Last updated: 2026</p>

        <p>
          These terms govern your use of Hengo, an AI-assisted Korean-learning app for software
          engineers and foreign professionals working in Korea. By creating an account, you agree
          to these terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Your account</h2>
        <p>
          You&apos;re responsible for keeping your login credentials secure and for the activity
          that happens under your account. You must be able to legally enter into this agreement
          to use Hengo.
        </p>

        <h2>Using the AI features</h2>
        <p>
          Hengo&apos;s chat, analyzer, message generator, interview simulator, and related features
          send the text you submit to a third-party AI provider (OpenAI) to generate a response.
          Don&apos;t submit content that is illegal, infringes someone else&apos;s rights, or contains
          sensitive personal information you wouldn&apos;t want processed by an AI model. AI output
          may be inaccurate — treat it as a study aid, not professional, legal, medical, or
          immigration advice (including for K-Specialist exam preparation).
        </p>

        <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>
          Don&apos;t attempt to disrupt the service, reverse-engineer it, scrape it at scale, or use
          it to generate content that harasses or harms others.
        </p>

        <h2>Your content</h2>
        <p>
          You keep ownership of what you write (messages, notes, vocabulary, interview scripts).
          You grant Hengo the limited right to store and process that content in order to provide
          the service to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Service availability</h2>
        <p>
          Hengo is provided &quot;as is,&quot; without warranty of any kind. Features may change,
          and the service may be interrupted for maintenance or otherwise.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these terms as the product evolves. Continued use after an update means you
          accept the revised terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>Questions about these terms can be sent to the Hengo team through your account settings.</p>
