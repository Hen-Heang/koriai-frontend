        <p>
          This describes what Hengo collects and how it&apos;s used. Hengo is built for a focused
          purpose — helping you learn workplace Korean — and only collects what that purpose needs.
        </p>

        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Account information</strong> — email address, and (if you sign in with Google)
            your Google profile name and photo.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Profile details you provide</strong> — Korean level, country, native language,
            occupation, years of experience, and learning goals, used to personalize lessons and AI
            responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Study activity</strong> — vocabulary decks and review history, chat
            conversations, corrections, interview practice sessions and scores, reading/listening
            progress, goals and tasks, and notes you write.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device information</strong> — a push-notification token if you opt in to
            notifications.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How it&apos;s used</h2>
        <p>
          Your profile and activity are used to run the app&apos;s features: generating
          personalized vocabulary and lessons, streaming AI chat and feedback, tracking your streaks
          and progress, and sending reminders you&apos;ve opted into. We don&apos;t sell your data.
        </p>

        <h2>Third parties</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Supabase</strong> stores your account and study data, protected by row-level
            security so only you can read your own records.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>OpenAI</strong> processes the text and audio you submit to AI features (chat,
            analyzer, message generator, interview simulator, listening generator, text-to-speech) in
            order to generate a response. It is not used to train Hengo&apos;s own product beyond
            that request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google</strong> is used only if you choose &quot;Sign in with Google,&quot; to verify your
            identity.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <p>
          You can update or delete your profile information from Settings, and disable push
          notifications at any time. To delete your account and associated data, use the account
          actions in Settings or contact us as described below.
        </p>

        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your data for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, your
          data is removed within a reasonable period, except where we&apos;re required to keep records
          for legal reasons.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy as the product evolves and will reflect the current version here.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>Questions about this policy can be sent to the Hengo team through your account settings.</p>
